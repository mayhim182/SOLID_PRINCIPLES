Now let's suppose there is some super hero
that can fly but we don't need to necessary classify
it as a bird.

So it will only 
```
Implement Fly interface but if the interface
had some other methods such as spread wings
then there is an issue.

Therefore we need to segregate each interface to serve absolute base requirements.
Ideally all interfaces should be functional interfaces

Also can be called as Single Responsibility applied to interfaces.
