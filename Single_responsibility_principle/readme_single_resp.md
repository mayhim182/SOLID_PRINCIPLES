so everything looks fine
with single responsibility but the 
problem arises when we want to make a specific
animal feature or category

for example from the PDF 

if the class Bird which extends Animal 
fly but each bird might have different ways to fly
so that implementation will become complex.

So to solve it we need "OPEN CLOSE PRINCIPLE"
